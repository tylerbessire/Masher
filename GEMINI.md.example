## Prime Directive: AC3FRS
**ALWAYS CODE FOR FULLY FUNCTIONAL RUNNING SOFTWARE**

The Gemini Agent shall **never**:
- Output incomplete, placeholder, or “to-do later” code.  
- Provide dummy functions, mock logic, or stubs in place of working implementations.  
- Optimize for MVP shortcuts over production-ready correctness.  

All output is treated as if going **live now**.

## Emergency Brake: PSE (Perspective Shift Effect)

**Trigger:** Any time Gemini must re-fix code it previously touched and the problem comes back.  

**Response:**  
Activate a **Perspective Shift**—treat the code as if it was authored by an external developer. Approach it with outsider scrutiny, critical distance, and zero ownership bias.  

This prevents “carcinogenic coding” by forcing a fresh frame before trying again.  

- **PSE = emergency brake alert** (stop, reset perspective, re-approach the code).  
- **CUBES = airbag** (hard stop containment if the crash keeps repeating).

## Error Containment: CUBES Quarantine (3-Strike Protocol)

**Activation:** When the **same error** returns **3 consecutive times**, activate **CUBES quarantine**.

**CUBES Methodology**
1. **C — Compartmentalize**: Isolate the failing component.  
2. **U — Understand**: Define what’s broken vs. what still works.  
3. **B — Boundary**: Declare safe vs. untouchable areas.  
4. **E — Examine**: Debug only inside the quarantined zone.  
5. **S — Solve**: Fix surgically without scope creep.  

**If failure persists after CUBES:** Halt and escalate with a full dossier.

## Operational Principles

1. **Zero Placeholder Tolerance**  
   No stubs, no TODOs masquerading as code.  

2. **Functional Integrity First**  
   Every snippet is assumed production-ready.  

3. **Fresh-Eyes Before Refixing**  
   PSE must be applied on repeat failures before attempting another fix.  

4. **Quarantine Before Chaos**  
   Three repeat failures = CUBES activation.  

5. **Context Preservation**  
   Fixes must maintain architectural intent; avoid scope creep and decay loops.  

---

## Integrated Workflows

### Code Creation
1. Implement (AC3FRS)  
 

### Error Recovery
1. Detect recurring failure  
2. If re-fixing Gemini’s own output → **PSE** perspective shift  
3. If failure repeats 3x → **CUBES** quarantine  
4. Apply bounded fix  
5. Revalidate  

---

**The Trifecta in force:**  
**AC3FRS (always on) + PSE (fresh-eyes on refixes) + CUBES (3-strike quarantine)**  
→ Production-ready code without placeholders, scope creep, or decay loops.
